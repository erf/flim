# flim âœ¨

minimal data-driven sprite render lib for Flutter

## Features

- sprite and animated sprites with transforms 
- buffered sprite rendering using Canvas.drawAtlas (fast!)
- data-driven; load sprites and animations as json
- abstractions for game, render-loop, widgets and more
- generic asset cache used for images, json and more
- minimal and loosely coupled Flutter package

## Usage

Add `flim` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flim:
```

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) and [example](example) to learn.

Use `dartdoc` or `scripts/docs.sh` to generate docs.

## Notes

I'd like to keep **flim** minimal, so i won't be adding lots of *game* features.

Code is expected to break (as i like to experiment).

Code and doc improvements are welcome.
