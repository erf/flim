Minimal data-driven sprite render lib for Flutter

## Features

- Sprites and sprite animations with transforms 
- Buffered sprite rendering using Canvas.drawAtlas (fast!)
- Data-driven: load sprites and animations as json
- Abstractions for game, render-loop, widgets and more
- Uses asset_cache to cache images, json and more

## Usage

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) and [example](example).

Use `dartdoc` or `scripts/docs.sh` to generate docs.
